# The Friendly Realtor Bot

Simple bot that runs via Twitter's API ruby wrapper as a dependency

To use, go to twitter and sign up to create an app.  With the security tokens it gives, place inside the script in the designated area.
Then simply pick which keyword variant of the script to use.  Look at the hashtags or keywords realtors use in your area for new listings, they are all repeats.
Helpful to change search parameters to only grab tweets in your state.

Bot will automatically search every ten minutes or so and favorite the tweets.  Helpful if you are in the realestate business and want your business to stay in realtor's heads.
